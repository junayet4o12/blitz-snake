# Blitz Snake

Welcome to Blitz Snake, the ultimate web game developed by me while practicing my coding skills to solve stronger functionality.

--> I developed a game using React called Blitz Snake. I created it during my free time while practicing my coding skills. I always try to tackle strong functionality, so I challenged myself to develop a snake game—and I succeeded!

## Key points about Blitz Snake:

--> **Development:** This game was developed without watching any videos or tutorials from YouTube or other platforms. I did, however, seek help from ChatGPT for some functionality that I couldn’t solve on my own.

## Device Compatibility:

--> **Keyboard Devices:** The game is controllable using a keyboard. Players can use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake and press the spacebar to pause the game.

--> **Keyboardless Devices:** For devices without a keyboard, on-screen control buttons are provided, allowing players to control the game with their fingers.

## --> Technologies Used:

1. **React for UI interaction.**
2. **Tailwind CSS for styling.**
3. **React-icons for icons.**
